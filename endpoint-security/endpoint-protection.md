# Endpoint Security

Endpoint security is the practice of protecting end-user devices (laptops, mobiles, IoT) from cyber threats and unauthorized access.

## Key Aspects
- **Device Protection:** Guarding against physical theft and logical threats (malware).
- **Data Security:** Encryption and backups.
- **Network Security:** Preventing endpoints from becoming entry points for attacks.
- **Hardening:** Disabling unnecessary applications and enforcing policies.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy & Surveillance:** Policies must be transparent. Hidden surveillance (e.g., keyloggers) is unethical and often illegal.
- **Data Minimization:** Collect only necessary logs and data.
- **Bias:** Security tools and AI algorithms must be transparent and not unfairly target specific groups.
- **Autonomy:** Policies should not be overly restrictive; BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) privacy must be respected.
- **Backdoors:** Security tools must not contain backdoors.
