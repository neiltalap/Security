# Vulnerability Fundamentals

## Definitions

### Software Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities are specific flaws or oversights in a piece of software that allow attackers to perform malicious actions, such as:
- Exposing or altering sensitive information.
- Disrupting or destroying a system.
- Taking control of a computer system or program.

Vulnerabilities are essentially weaknesses that attackers can leverage to their advantage.

### Vulnerabilities vs. Bugs
- **Software Bugs:** General errors, mistakes, or oversights in programs that result in unexpected and typically undesirable behavior.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** A subset of bugs that have security-relevant impact. A bug must allow attackers to do something they normally wouldn't be able to do.
- **Design Flaws:** Some vulnerabilities are not "bugs" in the traditional sense. A program might operate correctly according to its specifications (e.g., allowing edits to a critical system file) but still be insecure.

## Security and Reliability
Security is often considered a subset of reliability.
- **Reliable Program:** Relatively free of bugs, handles exceptional conditions gracefully, and is written "defensively."
- **Secure Program:** Similar to a robust program, but specifically designed to repel focused attacks targeting its environment and input.
