# Ethical Principles and Decision Making

Ethical behavior in security relies on core pillars and a structured decision-making process.

## Core Principles (The Pillars)

- **Mutuality:** Ensuring all parties understand the rules of engagement.
- **Generalizability:** Actions should follow principles applicable to all comparable situations.
- **Consideration:** Demonstrating authentic concern for the interests of others.
- **Respect/Privacy:** Upholding the dignity and rights of others, including confidentiality.
- **Integrity:** Ensuring decisions and processes are honest and straightforward.

## Decision-Making Process

A step-by-step approach to solving ethical problems:

1. **Identify the ethical problem.**
2. **Analyze the issues:** Evaluate in factual and conceptual terms (e.g., privacy, bias).
3. **Identify stakeholders:** Determine who is affected and their desired outcomes.
4. **Research existing laws/policies:**
   - **If a law exists:** Apply the ethical theories behind that law.
   - **If no law exists:** Propose three solutions (two extremes and one compromise) and verify them.
