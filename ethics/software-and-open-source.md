# Software and Open Source Ethics

Software consists of codified thoughts and is non-tangible, leading to historical debates on whether it is protected by Copyright or Patent.

## History of Software IP
- **1969:** IBM separated software from hardware bundling.
- **1970s:** Code was often exchanged freely (e.g., Unix at Berkeley).
- **1990s:** Shift toward stronger protection, alongside the rise of the open-source movement (e.g., Linux).

## Open Source Licensing

### Free Software Foundation (FSF)
Supports the **"four freedoms"**:
1. Run for any purpose.
2. Study and adapt.
3. Redistribute.
4. Improve the software.

### Open Source Initiative (OSI)
Similar goals to FSF but more lenient, allowing for integration with proprietary products.
