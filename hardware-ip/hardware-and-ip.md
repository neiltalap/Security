# Hardware and Intellectual Property (IP)

## Defining Property
- **Tangible Property:** Physical objects.
- **Intellectual Objects:** Creative works or innovations expressed in a tangible form.

## Intellectual Property (IP) Types
Main types of protection:
- **Copyright**
- **Patent** (Applied to tangible inventions like hardware)
- **Trademark**
- **Design**

## Hardware Considerations
- **Integrated Circuits (Microchips):** Protection is granted for the topographical design (the 3D pattern of layers), not the technical function itself.
- **Key Ethical Issues:** 
  - IP integrity and privacy by design.
  - Ethical use of chips in implants (bias/due care).
  - Manufacturing safety and climate impact (heat generation).
  - Reverse engineering.

## Semiconductor Business Models
- **IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturer):** Design and manufacture their own chips.
- **Fabless:** Design chips but outsource manufacturing.
- **Chipless:** Create and license ideas only.
