# Exploitation Basics

## Key Concepts

### Exploiting
The process of attacking a vulnerability in a program. This can involve:
- Running the program in a clever way.
- Altering or monitoring the program's environment while it runs.
- Using an inherently insecure program for its intended purpose.

### Exploit / Exploit Script
An external program or script used to perform an attack against a vulnerability.
