# Security Cornerstones (CIA Triad)

Security is often described as resting on three fundamental components: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

## Confidentiality
Requires that information be kept private.
- **Secrets:** Nation-state intelligence, trade secrets, sensitive personal info (medical, financial).
- **Authorized Access:** Ensuring only authenticated and authorized parties can see sensitive data.
- **Encryption:** Used to maintain confidentiality during storage or transfer.

## Integrity
The trustworthiness and correctness of data.
- **Prevention:** Preventing unauthorized changes to data or its source.
- **Detection:** Identifying when data or its origins have been altered.
- **Masquerading:** Breaches often involve users masquerading as others to manipulate data.

## Availability
The capability to use information and resources.
- **Resilience:** Ability to withstand Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Preventing attacks that exhaust CPU, disk, or network bandwidth to disable a program.
