# Data Protection Frameworks

Key legal frameworks govern how personal data is handled across different regions.

## Regional Frameworks
- **European Union:** The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is the primary law.
- **United Kingdom:** Governed by the **Data Protection Act 2018** and the "UK GDPR".
- **Global Context:** **Convention 108** (Council of Europe) aligns with GDPR; GDPR also has extraterritorial effects.
- **United States:** Lacks a single comprehensive law, relying instead on fragmented sector-specific regulations.

## Key GDPR Concepts
- **Personal Data:** Any information relating to an identified or identifiable "data subject" (e.g., name, ID, location data).
- **Special Categories:** Sensitive data requiring extra protection (race, politics, religion, health, biometrics).
- **Key Actors:**
    - **Data Subject:** The individual the data describes.
    - **Data Controller:** Determines the purpose of processing.
    - **Data Processor:** Processes data on behalf of the controller.
    - **Data Protection Authority (DPA):** The regulator (e.g., the ICO in the UK).

## Core Principles of Processing
Data must be processed:
- Fairly, lawfully, and transparently.
- For specific, limited purposes.
- With **Data Minimization** (adequate, relevant, not excessive).
- Accurately and kept no longer than necessary.
- Securely against malice or loss.

## Legal Bases for Processing
Processing is only lawful if it meets one of these:
1. Consent.
2. Contract execution.
3. Legal obligation.
4. Vital interests of the subject.
5. Public interest.
6. Legitimate interests.

## Data Subject Rights
- Right to be informed (transparency).
- Right of access, rectification, and erasure ("Right to be forgotten").
- Right to restrict or object to processing.
- Right to data portability.

## Security and Enforcement
- **Measures:** Must use "state of the art" and "appropriate" measures (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit).
- **Anonymisation vs. Pseudonymisation:**
    - **Pseudonymisation:** Data is masked but still considered personal data.
    - **Anonymisation:** Data cannot be re-identified; no longer considered personal data.
- **Fines:** Up to 4% of global turnover or €20M. Notable cases: British Airways (£20M), Marriott (£14M).
