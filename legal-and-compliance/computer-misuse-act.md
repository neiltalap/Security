# The Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA)

The CMA is the primary UK legislation regarding cybercrime.

## The Five Main Offences
1. **Unauthorized access to computer material:** Basic hacking.
2. **Unauthorized access with intent to commit further offences:** Hacking to facilitate other crimes (e.g., theft).
3. **Unauthorized acts with intent to impair the operation of a computer:** Includes DoS attacks and recklessness.
4. **Section 3A:** Making, supplying, or obtaining articles (tools) for use in offences 1 or 3.
5. **Section 3ZA:** Unauthorized acts causing, or creating a risk of, serious damage.

## Definition of a "Computer"
The Act intentionally does not define "computer" to allow for technological evolution. Case law (e.g., *DPP v McKeown*) defines it as a device for "storing, processing and retrieving information."
- **Examples:** Smartphones, smart fridges, cars, baby monitors, and industrial controllers.
